SAMPLE RUN 5
ONE GAME
Die rolling, catastrophes allowed, no surprises

Two catastrophes happened, the board shrunk, the player's position needed to 
be corrected but the player survived

Game ended because the number of turns reached the maximum

(To demonstrate this case the frequency of the catastrohpes was increased)
